# Research
I did a hefty amount of research for this project. Surveys, informal interviews, market research, and competitive analysis were all important parts of the design process. The biggest takeaway was that everyone's art-buying process is unique, so providing an intuitive, attractive platform and service for the customer was my foremost task. This information allowed me to organize features and flows for my product in a straightforward fashion
___
# Sketches
Next, I planned, sketched and iterated on features and created basic layouts. I modelled my site after existing patterns in the online industry, reducing clutter where necessary. I wireframed a few pages and made changes to my site structure and map as I went along
___
# Style Tiles and Mockups 
I turned to several sources for inspiration on a polished style that looked clean-cut and modern but also friendly. I decided to limit my use of color so that the art remained the focus of the site, and I used negative space as my primary organizational tool
___
# Coding
I coded the site for all screen sizes and the major browsers, using Sass, Bourbon, Neat, and a few jQuery plugins. My fonts came from Typekit.
